What is the purpose of this project? 

Bullying is a major problem in society. With the development of online communication and social media, it gives the unfortunate outlet for others to engage in and/or be a victim of disrespectful and derogatory dialogue. This classifier is designed to prevent this activity in all aspects of online communication, including social media platforms and online multiplayer games. The main goal of the project is to create a filtering system where online users feel free to express themselves and their ideas to others in a safe online environment.
